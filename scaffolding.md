# Three forms of scaffolding

## Level 1. more digits

At first user can do digits 0 and 1.

If user successfully do 1 X=2 times, unlock the next digit 2.

If user successfully do 2 X=2 times, unlock 3, so on and so forth.

If there's no next digit to unlock, go to next level.

X is adjustable.

## Level 2. less hints

Now user can do any digit from 0 to 9.

At first there's no blink, only stable gesture image.

While user success more and more times in Level 2, there will be more and more blank time.

Finally the gesture image will totally disappear, and the game will go to the next level.

## Level 3. faster

Now there's no gesture image on the screen, and there's a green progress bar on the bottom for counting down.

At first the bar will progress slowly.

While user success more and more times in Level 3, the progress bar will go faster and faster.
